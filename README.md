# IWSLT-BACKUP
The link the IWSLT dataset link doesn't work anymore on torchtext, and even the updated link only works on the experimental dataset (Nightly version) which has a different API for loading the dataset. All of my code broke since I can't reproduce it.

To remedy this I uploaded the dataset it its old version in a way that supports the old API. You won't have to change your code, you should only place the dataset in your `.data` folder, or your root folder.

If anyone has a better solution hit me up please.
